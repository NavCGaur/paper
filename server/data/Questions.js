These orbits or shells are represented by whole numbers (n=1,2,3...), with each shell having a maximum number of electrons it can hold. When an electron jumps from one orbit to another, energy is absorbed or emitted. The model also explains the stability of an atom based on the balance between centripetal force and electrostatic force."

It occurs at the surface of the liquid when the kinetic energy of the molecules is high enough to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them together.

Boiling is a rapid process that occurs throughout the liquid, leading to the formation of bubbles, whereas evaporation is a slower process that takes place only at the surface of the liquid."

Near the surface of the Earth, its value is approximately 9.81 m/s². This means that an object in free fall near the Earth's surface will accelerate at a rate of 9.81 m/s². \n\nThe acceleration due to gravity varies with altitude and depth. As we go higher above the Earth's surface, the value of acceleration due to gravity decreases. This is because the distance between the object and the center of the Earth increases, resulting in a weaker gravitational force. Similarly, as we go deeper below the Earth's surface, the value of acceleration due to gravity also decreases due to the reduced mass of the Earth below the object. However, these variations are relatively small and can be considered constant for most practical purposes."

Natural resources such as water, air, soil, minerals, and forests provide essential services like clean water, air, food, and raw materials for various industries. Without proper conservation measures, these resources can be depleted or polluted, leading to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. By conserving natural resources, we can reduce waste, protect habitats, and mitigate the effects of climate change. Conservation also helps in preserving cultural heritage and promoting sustainable development. Overall, the conservation of natural resources is essential for the well-being of both present and future generations."

    "marks": 4,
    "answer": "Mixed cropping is a farming practice where two or more crops are grown simultaneously in the same field. This method helps in reducing the risk of total crop failure as different crops have different requirements and are resistant to different pests and diseases. Additionally, mixed cropping increases the overall productivity of the land as it maximizes the use of available resources like sunlight, water, and nutrients. It also helps in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen in the soil. Moreover, mixed cropping can provide a variety of crops for consumption, thereby ensuring food security and increasing income for farmers. Overall, mixed cropping is an efficient and sustainable agricultural practice that offers numerous benefits to farmers and the environment."
